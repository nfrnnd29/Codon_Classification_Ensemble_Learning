# Codon_Classification_Ensemble_Learning

This code implements ensemble-learning classification of species Kingdom from DNA codon usage data sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where each record includes 69 attributes (64 codon-frequency features plus DNAtype, SpeciesID/SpeciesName, Ncodons, and Kingdom) across 13,028 rows with some missing values. The code follows a clear pipeline: import required libraries, inspect the 11-class Kingdom distribution (noting label imbalance), check for duplicates, handle missing values (including type issues in codon columns such as uuu and uuc), cast identifier columns as categorical, and apply min–max normalization so the codon features share a consistent numeric scale before modeling. 

Two ensemble approaches are then evaluated with stratified cross-validation: an XGBoost classifier tuned by varying n_estimators at a fixed learning rate of 0.02 (showing higher estimator counts improve accuracy, with the best tested setting at 1,800 estimators reaching ~0.919 mean accuracy) and a stacking ensemble that combines multiple base classifiers (Logistic Regression, KNN, CART, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes) with an XGBoost meta-learner (learning rate 0.02, 20 estimators), achieving ~0.934 mean accuracy. The code also notes that testing beyond 1,800 estimators was limited by Google Colab runtime/errors, but the observed trend suggests larger estimator values may further improve accuracy at the same learning rate.
